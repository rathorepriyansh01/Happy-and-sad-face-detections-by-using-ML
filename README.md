## ðŸ“– Project Description  
This project uses deep learning (TensorFlow/Keras) to classify human facial expressions into **happy** and **sad** categories.  
It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and uses the **Emotion Detection dataset** from Kaggle.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Vision  
- Build an accurate emotion recognition system.  
- Demonstrate the use of CNNs for binary image classification.  
- Explore real-world applications of facial expression analysis in healthcare, education, and human-computer interaction.  

---

## âœ¨ Key Features  
- âœ… Uses **KaggleHub** for automatic dataset download.  
- âœ… Image preprocessing & data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shift, flip).  
- âœ… CNN architecture with multiple convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.  
- âœ… **Early stopping callback** (stops when accuracy â‰¥ 81%).  
- âœ… Training & validation accuracy/loss visualization.  
- âœ… Achieves high accuracy in distinguishing happy vs sad faces.  

---

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, NumPy  
- **Dataset**: [Emotion Detection â€“ Happy or Sad (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aravindanr22052001/emotiondetection-happy-or-sad)  
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  

---

## ðŸ“Š Future Scope  
- ðŸ”¹ Extend model to multi-class emotion detection (anger, surprise, neutral, etc.).  
- ðŸ”¹ Deploy as a **web app** using Flask/Streamlit.  
- ðŸ”¹ Integrate with **real-time webcam feed** for live emotion recognition.  
- ðŸ”¹ Improve performance with **transfer learning** (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, MobileNet).  

---

## ðŸ“œ Notebook Details  
- Dataset is automatically downloaded from KaggleHub.  
- CNN model consists of **3 convolutional layers, pooling, dense layers, and dropout**.  
- Uses **binary crossentropy loss** and **Adam optimizer**.  
- Visualization of training & validation accuracy is included.  

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.  
3. Run all cells to download the dataset, build the model, and train it.  
4. Check the results (accuracy & plots).
